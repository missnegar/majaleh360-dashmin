## üöÄ Getting Started

This project is currently a **frontend prototype** and does not require a complex build process or package installation.

To run it, simply upload all the project files (`index.html`, `App.tsx`, `components/`, etc.) to a web server or a hosting provider that supports serving static files.

1.  Clone the repository or download the source code.
2.  Upload the files and folders to the `public_html` directory (or equivalent) on your web host.
3.  Navigate to `https://yourdomain.com/path/to/project/index.html` in your web browser.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap: From Prototype to Production

This is the first step in building a complete application. The next major phase involves developing a backend and integrating a database to make the functionality dynamic and persistent.

-   **Backend Development:** Create a RESTful API (e.g., using Node.js/Express) to handle data requests.
-   **Database Integration:** Connect the backend to a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store posts, users, settings, etc.
-   **Authentication:** Implement a secure user authentication system (e.g., using JWT).
-   **Deployment:** Set up a proper build process for the React app and deploy it alongside the backend application.
